Example applications include\n transcript-level RNA-Seq quantification, allele-specific/haplotype\n expression analysis (from RNA-Seq), transcription factor binding\n quantification in ChIP-Seq, and analysis of metagenomic data. It is\n based on an online-EM algorithm that results in space (memory)\n requirements proportional to the total size of the target sequences and\n time requirements that are proportional to the number of sampled\n fragments.

This\n    avoids duplicating the same data, once in the source file and once\n    in the database.\n  * The data base can be built up incrementally, that is new sequence\n    data can be added to the data base over time.\n  * The data base flexibly allows one to store any meta-data desired for\n    reads. This is accomplished with the concept of *tracks* that\n    implementors can add as they need them.\n  * The data is held in a compressed form equivalent to the .dexta and\n    .dexqv files of the data extraction module. Both the .fasta and\n    .quiva information for each read is held in the data base and can be\n    recreated from it. The .quiva information can be added separately and\n    later on if desired.\n  * To facilitate job parallel, cluster operation of the phases of the\n    assembler, the database has a concept of a *current partitioning* in\n    which all the reads that are over a given length and optionally\n    unique to a well, are divided up into *blocks* containing roughly a\n    given number of bases, except possibly the last block which may have\n    a short count. Often programs can be run on blocks or pairs of blocks\n    and each such job is reasonably well balanced as the blocks are all\n    the same size.

Recent technological advances\n enable the study of hundreds of thousands of human single-nucleotide\n polymorphisms at the population level. Because strategies for analyzing\n these data have not kept pace with the laboratory methods that generate\n the data, it is unlikely that these advances will immediately lead to\n an improved understanding of the genetic contribution to common human\n disease and drug response. Currently, no single analytical method\n allows us to extract all available information from a whole-genome\n association study. In fact, no single method can be optimal for all\n datasets, especially when the genetic architecture for diseases can\n vary substantially, as is certainly the case. Therefore, an integrative\n platform is needed to accommodate multiple analytical methods for\n analysis as we learn more about genetic architecture. As a result,\n we are developing a system for the analysis of genome-wide association\n data that will incorporate several analytical approaches as filters to\n allow a scientist to choose whatever analytical methods they wish to\n apply. PLATO (PLatform for the Analysis, Translation, and Organization\n of large-scale data) will incorporate a number of filters to select\n the important SNPs in a genome-wide association study.\n .\n Whole-genome Association Study Pipeline (WASP) has recently been\n absorbed into PLATO. WASP was designed to aid in retrieving, evaluating,\n formatting, and analyzing genotypic and clinical data from the latest\n large-scale genotyping studies. WASP implements a battery of quality\n control procedures to assess the data. Among the currently available\n procedures are the examination of marker and sample genotyping\n efficiency, allele frequency calculations, checks of Mendelian error\n (if applicable) and gender discrepancies (based on available chromosome X\n and Y genotypes), and tests of Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium. Additionally,\n WASP can retrieve and format data for other software programs such as the\n Graphical Representation of Relationships (GRR) program, or STRUCTURE,\n and depending on the nature of the samples and the depth of examination\n the user desires to pursue. Beyond the quality control aspect of this\n application, WASP can perform standard tests of association using the\n Transmission Disequilibrium Test TDT for family-based datasets and the\n chi-square test of association for case-control datasets.","interface":null,"biology":null,"fields":null,"use":null,"popcon":null,"doi":"10.1142/9789814295291_0034","topics":null,"edam_scopes":null,"bio.tools":null,"OMICtools":null,"SEQwiki":null,"SciCrunch":null,"RRID":null},{"package":"plink","distribution":"debian","release":"sid","component":"main","version":"1.07","source":"plink","homepage":"http://zzz.bwh.harvard.edu/plink/","description":"whole-genome association analysis toolset","long_description":" plink expects as input the data from SNP (single\n nucleotide polymorphism) chips of many individuals\n and their phenotypical description of a disease.\n It finds associations of single or pairs of DNA\n variations with a phenotype and can retrieve\n SNP annotation from an online source.\n .\n SNPs can evaluated individually or as pairs for their\n association with the disease phenotypes.
